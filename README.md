# Titanic-EDA-Visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset using Python

# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Description
This project is part of my data science internship. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover hidden patterns and insights using visualizations.

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle)

## 📊 What I Did
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Visualized data using:
  - ✅ Bar Charts (for categorical data)
  - ✅ Histograms (for numeric distributions)
  - ✅ Correlation Heatmap (for numeric feature relationships)
- Summarized key insights based on visual patterns

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Females** had a much higher survival rate than males  
- **1st class** passengers were more likely to survive  
- **People who paid higher fares** had better chances of survival
- **Young to middle-aged adults (20–40)** made up the majority of passengers.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the notebook
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter/Kaggle
3. Run the cells step-by-step to view analysis
